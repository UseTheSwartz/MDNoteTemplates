# MDNoteTemplates


## Objective
To provide a few basic templates for note taking. Knowledge Management is something a lot of people and organizations alike struggle with, myself included. Learning to use tools like Obsidian and languages like Markdown help to improve one's efficiency and stop the dreaded questions lik "What did we talk about in this meeting?" or "Where were we on this project that was shelved 10 months ago?"
